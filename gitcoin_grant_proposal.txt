# 🏆 Gitcoin Grant Proposal – Decentralized Social Media Platform

## 📌 Summary  
This project is an **open-source, blockchain-based social media platform** that ensures **free speech & decentralization** while enforcing **KYC verification** for user accountability. Built on **Polygon** with **IPFS/Arweave**, it provides a censorship-resistant environment for digital expression.  

## 🌟 Why This Matters  
Social media platforms today are heavily centralized, leading to **censorship, data control, and biased moderation**. Our platform ensures:  
- **Decentralized content ownership** (users own their posts).  
- **Immutable records on the blockchain** (no deletions or manipulations).  
- **KYC verification for accountability** (no bot/spam accounts).  

## 💰 Funding Goals  
We seek funding to:  
1. **Develop & deploy smart contracts on Polygon**.  
2. **Integrate Civic API for KYC verification**.  
3. **Build a Web3 frontend with IPFS/Arweave storage**.  
4. **Optimize for Progressive Web App (PWA) support**.  

## 👥 Why Support Us?  
Your contribution will help:  
- **Accelerate development & open-source adoption**.  
- **Build a censorship-resistant platform for free speech**.  
- **Empower communities with decentralized ownership**.
