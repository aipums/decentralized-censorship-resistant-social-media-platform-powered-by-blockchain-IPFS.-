# 🚀 Decentralized Censorship-Resistant Social Media Platform

## 🌍 Overview  
This is an **open-source, blockchain-based social media platform** designed to ensure free speech while maintaining **user accountability** through KYC verification. Built on **Polygon** with **IPFS/Arweave** for decentralized storage, this platform ensures posts remain censorship-resistant and immutable.

## 🔥 Features  
✅ **Decentralized & Censorship-Resistant** – No central authority can remove content.  
✅ **KYC-Verified Users** – Civic API ensures only real users participate.  
✅ **Blockchain-Powered** – Posts are stored securely on **Polygon**.  
✅ **Decentralized Storage** – Uses **IPFS/Arweave** for storing media permanently.  
✅ **Progressive Web App (PWA)** – Optimized for mobile & desktop users.  

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- **Blockchain**: Polygon (Ethereum Layer 2)  
- **Storage**: IPFS / Arweave  
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity (EVM-compatible)  
- **Frontend**: Next.js + Tailwind CSS  
- **Web3 Integration**: Ethers.js / Web3.js
